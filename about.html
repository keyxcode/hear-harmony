        <p>Relative harmony was developed to help musicians who wish to improve their relative pitch.</p>
        <p>Relative pitch is the ability of a person to identify one or many given musical notes by comparing it to a reference note. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through ear training.</p>
        <p>While there are quite a few ear training methods out there, the goal and method of Relative Harmony is slightly different in 2 main areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, we don't emphasize the importance of naming the intervals. Rather, our goal is to help the students directly hear the notes themselves, given a reference pitch. While it's certainly helpful, and even crucial to first learn how to recognize intervals by name, we think ultimately it adds an unecessary layer of complexity. It's still important to hear what these intervals feel like, however.</li>
          <li>Second, we don't restrict the random notes to only conventional combinations, such as major, minor, diminished, etc. Being able to hear strange combinations will be especially helpful for musicians who wish to develop their own harmonic vocabulary. Sometimes it's the chord that you can't name that you wish to use.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Happy ear training!</p>
