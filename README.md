#### Description

**Hear Harmony** was developed to help musicians improve their *relative pitch*. 

*Relative pitch* is the ability to identify one or many given musical notes by comparing it to a reference note. Unlike perfect pitch, this can be developed through ear training.

#### How to use

Simply click the *"Play Reference"* button, carefully listen to it, then click *"Play Random"*, which gives you one or many random notes, depending on the number of random notes you select. Next, play your guess on the on-screen piano until you get it right.

After you get the answers right, click *"Shuffle"* to get a new set of random notes. If it's too difficult, you could click *"Show Answer"*, which does what it says.

#### Methodology

**Hear Harmony** is uniqe in that it does not restrict the random notes to only conventional combinations, such as major, minor, diminished, etc. We believe that true relative pitch should mean being able to hear any strange note combination. Besides, this will be especially helpful for musicians who wish to enrich their harmonic vocabulary. Sometimes, the chord you can not name is the one you wish you could use.

Happy ear training!
