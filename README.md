#### Description

**Hear Harmony** helps musicians train and improve their *relative pitch*. 

*Relative pitch* is the ability to identify one or many given musical notes by ear, given a reference note. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through ear training. This skill is useful for musicians of any level, but especially intermediate and advanced ones who wish to play by ear, or transcribe music.

#### Modes

There are has 2 main playing modes: ***Train*** and ***Challenge***:
* ***Train***: You are free to give your answers without any time restriction, how ever many times you want. 

    Simply click the *"Play Reference"* button, carefully listen to it, then click *"Play Random"*, which gives you one or many random notes, depending on how many you select. Next, play your guess on the on-screen piano until you get it right.

    After you get the answers right, click *"Shuffle"* to get a new set of random notes. If it's too difficult, you could click *"Show Answer"*, which does what it says.



* ***Challenge***: You're given a maximum of 10 seconds per random note to figure out the answer, and if you get one wrong answer, you lose that round. 

    If you log in, you could save the high score you get in this mode.

In both modes, the reference note is also randomized each time you get a new set of random notes. This behavior is by design, because it helps your ears tune to different reference point.

#### Methodology

While there are a few other ear training apps out there, the goal and method of **Hear Harmony** is slightly different in 2 main areas:
- First, we don't emphasize the importance of naming out the intervals such as minor 2nd, Major 7th, Major 9th, etc. Rather, our goal is to help the users directly hear the notes themselves, given a reference pitch. While it's certainly helpful, and even crucial to first learn how to recognize intervals by name, we think it's ultimately more important to directly hear the notes.
- Second, we don't restrict the random notes to only conventional combinations, such as major, minor, diminished, etc. We believe that it's important to be able to hear any strange combination! This sharpens your ears even more and enrich your harmonic vocabulary in the process.

Happy ear training!
